Hi, I'm Tate. I'm an engineer at [Twitch](https://www.twitch.tv/), where I focus on client engineering and expanding Twitch outside of the core desktop experience. If you've used Twitch's mobile web or TV applications, you've interacted with my code.

Before that, I spent 5 years working at Silicon Valley startups of varying sizes, typically in full stack or backend web engineering roles. I've worked for 3 [Y Combinator](https://www.ycombinator.com/) companies, and companies at every stage of venture funding: seed funded and through IPO. I've led and grown engineering teams from 2 engineers to several times that.

Occasionally I do consulting or contract work, like my work with [EVmatch](https://www.evmatch.com/). If you have a project in mind, [send me an email](mailto:tatethurston@gmail.com).

I've taught introductory programming courses and corporate trainings. At the beginning of my career, I worked on antibody engineering and was an author on a [published research paper](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5006801/). I hold a Neuroscience B.S. from the University of California, Santa Cruz.

I've worked extensively with [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) and love an [omakase](https://dhh.dk/2012/rails-is-omakase.html) ethos, but find myself reaching for [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) more often these days. Iâ€™m interested in improving the robustness of software and increasing the velocity of delivering it. I'm a big believer in making invalid states unrepresentable in software through data modeling and type systems.
